It\'s a geospatial technique that calculates aggregate statistics (e.g., mean, sum, maximum) of the pixel values of a raster (i.e. cell values) that fall within areas defined by another dataset. The method has diverse applications such as determining vegetation health in an agricultural field, assess surface water availability in watersheds, or approximate the height of buildings.","permalink":"/fused-docs/basics/usecases/zonal-stats"}],"unlisted":false}')}}]);
